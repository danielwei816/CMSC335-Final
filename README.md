## App Description

Our app allows users to plan trips they want to make in the future. This can help them
organize and keep track of all travel plans they have. The user inputs data
such as their name, email, destination, start date, end data, and the purpose of their trip.
We included a weather API so that the user can check the weather of potential travel locations.
The user can view all of their trips by submitting their email.
